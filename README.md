# Front_End_Test
The goal of this test was to complete 3 questions where some kind of coding challenge was to be completed. As of now (10/12/2019) I have completed part 3, and have started on part 1. 

My approach to this test was to have each part in a seperate file and to use HTML and JavaScript to create the code. 

### How to run the code
To run my code, you first open up the front-end-test folder found in the git repository. Then to run part 1 and 2 you will open up their respective files in Visual Studio Code (or other editor of allowing JavaScript code to be run). 

To run part 3 you will just double click the file and this will open up the webpage version and you can then test the functionality from there. To see the code of this you can open the file in any text editor or press f12 when running the page.

### What I would do next
I would continue to program and finish off the JavaScript code that I have missed out on unfortunately. I would then adapt the JavaScript sections to be able to be linked to a HTML page so that these can be seen and understood more easily to the user.

### What did I struggle with
I struggled with teh understanding of how the question was meant to be coded for the first 2 parts as I have been very busy and have had little to no time to be able to delve into the work nad get an understanding of the work needed.
